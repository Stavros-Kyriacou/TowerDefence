Issue

Enemies can lock onto players through walls, dont know if this is good for melee enemies because they will start backtracking away from objective in some cases

This can be avoided by making their aggro ranges much smaller

It could also be solved after i implement the aggro timer

If the aggro timer doesnt solve the issue

A solution i can think of is if the player aggros the enemy, do a raycast in the direction of the player and check if it hits a wall, if there is a wall in the way do not aggro the player







Spell/Attack Damage

when the spell does damage to enemies, perform a calculation that takes values from the player
eg. TakeDamage(damage * spell dmg multiplier * crit dmg)
